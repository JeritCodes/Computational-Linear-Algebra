# 1 Python for Linear Algebra
## 1.1 Pseudocode: the new language for algorithm design
Pseudocode is a way to describe algorithms in a structured but plain language. It helps in planning the logic without worrying about the syntax of a specific programming language. weâ€™ll use Python-flavored pseudocode to describe various matrix operations.
> There are varities of approaches in writing pseudocode. Students can adopt any of the standard approach to write pseudocode.
## 1.1.1 Matrix Sum
**Mathematical Procedure:**

To add two matrices $A$ and $B$, both matrices must have the same dimensions. The sum $C$ of two matrices $A$ and $B$ is calculated element-wise:

$$C[i][j] = A[i][j] + B[i][j]$$

**Example:**

Let $A$ and $B$ be two $2 \times 2$ matrices:

$$ A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4 \end{bmatrix}, \quad B = \begin{bmatrix} 5 & 6 \\ 7 & 8 \end{bmatrix} $$

The sum $C$ is:


**Pseudocode:**

$$ C = A + B = \begin{bmatrix} 1+5 & 2+6 \\ 3+7 & 4+8 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 6 & 8 \\ 10 & 12 \end{bmatrix} $$

```python
FUNCTION matrix_difference(A, B):
    # Determine the number of rows and columns in matrix A
    rows = number_of_rows(A)
    cols = number_of_columns(A)
    
    # Create an empty matrix C with the same dimensions as A and B
    C = create_matrix(rows, cols)
    
    # Iterate through each row
    FOR i FROM 0 TO rows-1:
        # Iterate through each column
        FOR j FROM 0 TO cols-1:
            # Calculate the difference for each element and store it in C
            C[i][j] = A[i][j] - B[i][j]
    
    # Return the result matrix C
    RETURN C
END FUNCTION
```
**Explanation:**
1. Determine the number of rows and columns in matrix $A$.
2. Create a new matrix $C$ with the same dimensions.
3. Loop through each element of the matrices and add corresponding elements.
4. Return the resulting matrix $C$.
## 1.1.2 Matrix Difference
**Mathematical Procedure:**

To subtract matrix $B$ from matrix $B$, both matrices must have the same dimensions. The difference $C$ of two matrices $A$ and $B$ is calculated element-wise:

$$C[i][j] = A[i][j] - B[i][j]$$

**Example:**

Let $A$ and $B$ be two $2 \times 2$ matrices:

$$A = \begin{bmatrix} 9 & 8 \\ 7 & 6 \end{bmatrix}, \quad B = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4 \end{bmatrix}$$

The difference $C$ is:

$$C = A - B = \begin{bmatrix} 9-1 & 8-2 \\ 7-3 & 6-4 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 8 & 6 \\ 4 & 2 \end{bmatrix}$$
