# 1 Python for Linear Algebra
## 1.1 Pseudocode: the new language for algorithm design
Pseudocode is a way to describe algorithms in a structured but plain language. It helps in planning the logic without worrying about the syntax of a specific programming language. weâ€™ll use Python-flavored pseudocode to describe various matrix operations.
> There are varities of approaches in writing pseudocode. Students can adopt any of the standard approach to write pseudocode.
## 1.1.1 Matrix Sum
**Mathematical Procedure:**

To add two matrices $A$ and $B$, both matrices must have the same dimensions. The sum $C$ of two matrices $A$ and $B$ is calculated element-wise:

$$C[i][j] = A[i][j] + B[i][j]$$

**Example:**

Let $A$ and $B$ be two $2 \times 2$ matrices:

$$ A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4 \end{bmatrix}, \quad B = \begin{bmatrix} 5 & 6 \\ 7 & 8 \end{bmatrix} $$

The sum $C$ is:


**Pseudocode:**

$$ C = A + B = \begin{bmatrix} 1+5 & 2+6 \\ 3+7 & 4+8 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 6 & 8 \\ 10 & 12 \end{bmatrix} $$

```python
FUNCTION matrix_difference(A, B):
    # Determine the number of rows and columns in matrix A
    rows = number_of_rows(A)
    cols = number_of_columns(A)
    
    # Create an empty matrix C with the same dimensions as A and B
    C = create_matrix(rows, cols)
    
    # Iterate through each row
    FOR i FROM 0 TO rows-1:
        # Iterate through each column
        FOR j FROM 0 TO cols-1:
            # Calculate the difference for each element and store it in C
            C[i][j] = A[i][j] - B[i][j]
    
    # Return the result matrix C
    RETURN C
END FUNCTION
```
**Explanation:**
1. Determine the number of rows and columns in matrix $A$.
2. Create a new matrix $C$ with the same dimensions.
3. Loop through each element of the matrices and add corresponding elements.
4. Return the resulting matrix $C$.
## 1.1.2 Matrix Difference
**Mathematical Procedure:**

To subtract matrix $B$ from matrix $B$, both matrices must have the same dimensions. The difference $C$ of two matrices $A$ and $B$ is calculated element-wise:

$$C[i][j] = A[i][j] - B[i][j]$$

**Example:**

Let $A$ and $B$ be two $2 \times 2$ matrices:

$$A = \begin{bmatrix} 9 & 8 \\ 7 & 6 \end{bmatrix}, \quad B = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4 \end{bmatrix}$$

The difference $C$ is:

$$C = A - B = \begin{bmatrix} 9-1 & 8-2 \\ 7-3 & 6-4 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 8 & 6 \\ 4 & 2 \end{bmatrix}$$

**Pseudocode:**

```
    FUNCTION matrix_difference(A, B):
    # Determine the number of rows and columns in matrix A
    rows = number_of_rows(A)
    cols = number_of_columns(A)
    
    # Create an empty matrix C with the same dimensions as A and B
    C = create_matrix(rows, cols)
    
    # Iterate through each row
    FOR i FROM 0 TO rows-1:
        # Iterate through each column
        FOR j FROM 0 TO cols-1:
            # Calculate the difference for each element and store it in C
            C[i][j] = A[i][j] - B[i][j]
    
    # Return the result matrix C
    RETURN C
END FUNCTION
```
**In more human readable format the above pseudocode can be written as:**

``` 
FUNCTION matrix_difference(A, B):
    Get the number of rows and columns in matrix A
    Create an empty matrix C with the same dimensions
    FOR each row i:
        FOR each column j:
            Set C[i][j] to the difference of A[i][j] and B[i][j]
    RETURN the matrix C
END FUNCTION
```
**Explanation:**

1. Determine the number of rows and columns in matrix $A$.
2. Create a new matrix $C$ with the same dimensions.
3. Loop through each element of the matrices and subtract corresponding elements.
4. Return the resulting matrix $C$.

## 1.1.3 Matrix Product
**Mathematical Procedure:**

To find the product of two matrices $A$ and $B$, the number of columns in $A$ must be equal to the number of rows in $B$ . The element $C[i][j]$ in the product matrix $C$ is computed as:

$$ C[i][j] = \sum_{k} A[i][k] \cdot B[k][j] $$

**Example:**

Let $A$ be a $2 \times 3$ matrix and $B$ be a $3 \times 2$ matrix:

$$ A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\ 4 & 5 & 6 \end{bmatrix}, \quad B = \begin{bmatrix} 7 & 8 \\ 9 & 10 \\ 11 & 12 \end{bmatrix} $$
**The product $C$ is:**
$$C = A \cdot B = \begin{bmatrix} 58 & 64 \\ 139 & 154 \end{bmatrix}$$
**Pseudocode:**
```
FUNCTION matrix_product(A, B):
    # Get the dimensions of A and B
    rows_A = number_of_rows(A)
    cols_A = number_of_columns(A)
    rows_B = number_of_rows(B)
    cols_B = number_of_columns(B)
    
    # Check if multiplication is possible
    IF cols_A != rows_B:
        RAISE Error("Incompatible matrix dimensions")
    
    # Initialize result matrix C
    C = create_matrix(rows_A, cols_B)
    
    # Calculate matrix product
    FOR each row i FROM 0 TO rows_A-1:
        FOR each column j FROM 0 TO cols_B-1:
            # Compute the sum for C[i][j]
            sum = 0
            FOR each k FROM 0 TO cols_A-1:
                sum = sum + A[i][k] * B[k][j]
            C[i][j] = sum
    
    RETURN C
END FUNCTION
```
A more human readable version of the `pseudocode` is shown below:
```
FUNCTION matrix_product(A, B):
    Get the number of rows and columns in matrix A
    Get the number of columns in matrix B
    Create an empty matrix C with dimensions rows_A x cols_B
    FOR each row i in A:
        FOR each column j in B:
            Initialize C[i][j] to 0
            FOR each element k in the common dimension:
                Add the product of A[i][k] and B[k][j] to C[i][j]
    RETURN the matrix C
END FUNCTION
```
**Explanation:**

1. Determine the number of rows and columns in matrices $A$ and $B$.
2. Create a new matrix $C$ with dimensions $\text{rows}(A)\times \text{columns}(B)$.
3. Loop through each element of the resulting matrix $C[i][j]$ and calculate the dot    product of $i$ the row of $A$ to the $j$ th column of $B$ for each element.
4. Return the resulting matrix $C$.
## 1.1.4 Determinant
**Mathematical Procedure:**

To find the determinant of a square matrix $A$, we can use the Laplace expansion, which involves breaking the matrix down into smaller submatrices. For a $2 \times 2$ matrix, the determinant is calculated as:
$$\text{det}(A) = A[0][0] \cdot A[1][1] - A[0][1] \cdot A[1][0]$$
For larger matrices, the determinant is calculated recursively.
